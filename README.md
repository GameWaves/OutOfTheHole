# Out of the Hole Game

Out of the Hole is a video game created as part of an EPITA school project. 

## Main ideas
Out of the Hole is a 2D multiplayer video game in which the aim is for the two players to reach the surface of an unknown planet by defeating the various enemies and difficulties on the game map. Both players can die during a fight with an enemy, but they cannot die when they are moving around the terrain and trying to reach the surface.

## Contribution
Given that the video game is a study project, we are not authorised to include any external code for the time being. However, we are keen to do our bit for open-source. That's why the game's code is publicly accessible, and the builds are too. 
Open issues are accepted for bug reports only. Any pull request to add code will be automatically refused.
The CONTRIBUTING.md file is for the information of team members only.

## Download
Artifacts are the builds of commits made on the different branches. These are alpha builds that are subject to a huge number of bugs. They are also unsigned, so can be detected as viruses. Beta builds are made on the master branch and are available in the GitHub release and are signed for MacOS, Windows and Linux.
